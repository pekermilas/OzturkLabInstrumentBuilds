\textbf{Photoluminescence} is the emission of light by the excited molecules and/or 
molecule clusters. Here we are intended to observe photon emission from the defects 
within crystalline structures such as diamond and cubic boron nitride. Given that these
materials known to be opaque in visible light range, we are building a \textbf{reflecting 
light microscope}[refhere]. Although wide-field excitation (similar to epifluorescence 
[refhere]) based emission measurements from an ensemble of defects have their own 
importance in characterization, we pursue investigating properties of individual defects/
emitters. This requires our reflecting light microscope to be a \textbf{confocal system}.  

\subsection{Reflecting Light Microscopes Overview}
On typical an upright or inverted microscope, illumination light comes from a direction 
relative to sample surface, while the collection or imaging is done in the opposite direction. 
Therefore in terms of optical components, illumination and imaging sides differ in those
systems. For example in illumination side a special lens called \textbf{Condenser} focuses
the light on to the sample while in the imaging side another special lens called \textbf{
Objective} lens collects the light coming from the sample. These special lenses and the
typical upright and inverted microscope configurations are shown in Figure\ref{fig:CondenserAndObjective}.

		structures indicating the positions of special lenses (\textbf{Condenser and objective}).}

\end{figure}

On the other hand, in a reflecting microscope illumination and imaging are done through the
same optical path or by same optics. As it is shown in Figure\ref{fig:ReflectingMicroscope},
shared optical path allows one (1) additional port for imaging and/or illuminating the sample
on a typical reflecting microscope. This port is very frequently assigned to white-light
(\textbf{bright-field}) imaging through a camera, so it is called the camera port. As a result
any additional illumination and/or imaging on top of the default system, require a custom
design optical system with the ability to finely couple with the existing microscope.

\subsection{Confocal Systems Overview}
A \textbf{confocal system} is an imaging system that utilizes a spatial filter
(or simply a pinhole) before the imaging component for strictly matching the illumination 
volume with the observation volume as it is shown in Figure\ref{fig:WidefieldVsConfocal}. Because 
of very likely chromatic aberrations \footnote{\url{https://www.microscopyu.com/tutorials/chromatic}} 
through the imaging components, usually illumination is done by a single color light source such as 
a laser. The pinhole suppresses the out-of-excitation volume light dramatically, so it increases 
the resolution of imaging system, Figure\ref{fig:WidefieldVsConfocalResolution}.

Microscope manufacturers very frequently incorporate additional openings (called \textbf{microscope ports})
on sides, front and even at the bottom of microscope bodies which allows the operator to 
couple additional imaging and illumination systems into the microscope. Although this is 
a very common practice in the case of transmission microscopes (upright and inverted as well),
reflecting microscopes usually don't have these additional ports, Figure\ref{fig:ReflectingMicroscope}. 
Because of missing ports, turning a reflecting microscope is considerably harder into 
a confocal system compared to transmission microscopes. 

\subsection{Confocal Reflecting Light Microscope for PL Measurements}

Our goal is to observe emission from excited lattice-defects in solids like boron 
nitride(BN) and diamond[REF HERE!!!]. These materials are not particularly transparent
to visible light\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron_nitride}}. Moreover
defect formation (particularly in the case of BN) is induced by ion bombardment, so
neither the density nor spatial distribution of defects are known prior to a PL 
measurement. The lack of information on defect positions introduces the requirement 
of active search for defects within the sample volume, so a confocal imaging system 
with the capability of scanning. To overcome the refractive index issue and satisfying 
the confocality in imaging, we built a confocal reflecting light microscope as shown
in Figure\ref{fig:ConfocalReflectingMicroscopeFull}.

Although the purpose of individual parts can not be explained accurately within the 
structure, it is a common practice to divide the whole system into 4 essential zones 
for educational purposes as in Figure\ref{fig:ConfocalReflectingMicroscopeZones}.
